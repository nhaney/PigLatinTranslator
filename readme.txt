********PIG LATIN TRANSLATOR PROGRAM*****************
Usage: $ ./atinlay [filename] {1}*

*Final argument is optional. If you don't pass anything translation will appear
on standard output. If you pass 1 in as the second argument the program will
output the translated text to a file whose name is the pig latin translated
version of the original file.

For example: declaration.txt -> eclarationday.txt
